### Notes from a fireside chat with [Trevor Bennett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevor-bennett-813654a1/) & questions I asked him. 

**Background**: Each week in Satellite Systems, an ECE and MechE elective, at Olin College of Engineering, our professor Dr. Whitney Lohmeyer brings in a speaker. This week our class heard from Trevor, the CEO of Starfish Space, a company building a satellite to: collect space debris and extend the life of other (enterprise) satellites. 

*Notes from his presentation:*

a) A company can die in the contract proposal process. For example, if Starfish didn't have venture capital money, they probably would've shut down as they were waiting on a contract from the NSF. The NSF took 9 months to respond. *I wish I would've asked: What problems outside of the space sector would make your job easier? <- I think this question can be asked to climate and bio founders too.*

b) He met his co-founder at Blue Origin, where they teamed up to build Starfish Space. *I'd be curious to analyze if more founder teams have come out of college friendships or career friendships and which ones have a higher success rate.* 

c) He has a PhD in aerospace engineering but is spending most of his time hiring, setting team culture, working on the revenue model, talking to VCs, etc. *I noticed a similar thread amongst the founders in MIT's Tough Tech cohort when I attended their summit in Oct. 22'.*

d) The US is buying commercial everything, as mentioned in [Biden's SOTU address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzcBTUvVp7M). *The dynamic of the government incentivizing US businesses to purchase from each other reminds me of the mini YC economy that happens between founders of the same/different batch. I'd be curious if there's a category error in that analogy.*

e) There are experimential licenses the government gives out for space experimentation. Other technology bodies like the FAA have them. These licenses allow labs, universities, companies to develop new technology without interfering with current services.

f) I vaguely remember him mentioning something about the liability of the spacecraft isn't on them but a customer or user. This could be wrong but I thought of [Section 230](https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230) and the tricky game companies play with customers and regulators to ensure proper use of their service without liability for X. 

*Notes on questions I asked:*

**Q:** What does diligence look like in a hard tech field and is it normal for hard tech companies to take non-dilutive and dilutive capital? 

**A:** I'm paraphrasing but he mentioned the path to $1B is the first thing VC's want to hear about. He and his co-founder first pitched a VC on a plan to make $50M and the VC said that wasn't enough revenue to have investment upside. In addition, because hard tech is milestone based, Starfish operates in a flywheel that helps them recieve VC funding and inbound customers simultaneously. Step 1 is to build the satellite and fly a mission, proving the technology and desired use case. For example, this summer they're launching Otter Pup to dock with an operational LEO. Step 2 is to get new customers whom Starfish can test their technology on. Step 3 is to work with company on resources they need to dock and fly the mission again (reference to Step 1). So, in this case, the diligence is successful missions and a growing increase of customers. 

The non-dilutive capital allows them to extend runway without decreasing the amount of employee ownership (equity).

**Q:** I followed up with: am I correct in saying that a customer would be interested in buying the Starfish Space service because they have an economic incentive to keep their satellite in space, even for 5 more years, because of the high capital cost to produce another one?

**A:** I’m paraphrasing again but Trevor responded by saying it costs $200M to build a satellite and the average life is 15 years. With some quick math, that means to break even, a company needs at least $13M revenue per year. So a 3-5 year boost has an impact, especially if the satellite company they’re working with has paying customers who might leave if the satellite de-orbits. Connecting this to a point from Al Tadros’ talk last week, I’d be curious to ask Trevor if space companies have an economic incentive to remove debris while deorbiting. That too costs money. And, interestingly, most satellites de-orbit because of fuel runout so a use case for Starfish could be refueling-as-a-service. 

*To research:*

a) ITAR: International Traffic in Arms Regulations. Space territory is treated as soverign territory therefore a war can launch if an invasion happens. I'm curious about whether debris from other nations interacting with US territory can be handled by the US or if this is protected under the sovereign and space treaty (not real name). In other words, is the US able to dispose of another countries garbage so the US' satellites don't suffer from damage. And if not, who is liable if a collision occurs. 

b) SBIR: Small Business Innovation Research. It awards small businesses with opportunities to propose innovative ideas that meet R&D requirements of the government. Congress has a federal mandate on certain companies to use this. 

**[Starfish](https://www.starfishspace.com/) is a very cool company with solid management (64% of 25 person team are engr's) and technology implementation (their high-level stack is a combination of robotics, satellites, AI, and IoT)!**

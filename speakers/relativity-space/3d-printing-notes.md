### Background on Relativity Space

*What does the company do:* Relativity Space is a company that 3D prints rockets and has a full 3D design space in Los Angeles. Their intention behind being both a 3D printing (uses 100th the amount of parts of traditional manufacturing) and a rocket company is that companies that want to succeed with 3D printing rockets need to have both a facility and the rocket parts. Without it, the costs and communication would be too high and the margins wouldn't be optimal. 

3D printing is a better cost structure than current aerospace manufacturing because the latter require assembly lines and fixed tooling (part of the process that does one thing. High capex to build and high sunk cost if you want to change factory or supply chain) whereas 3D printing is software design based and iterations can happen faster because it's tech based not labor based. 



[Brief research on 3D printing](https://egrove.olemiss.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1399&context=hon_thesis):

3D printers build products one layer at a time. Similar to an assembly line where each labor unit (human) specializes on completing on part of a good before handing it to the person adjacent to them. 

Steps of 3D printing:

1. Create a 3D blueprint using CAD. 
2. Load the 3D printer with raw materials and prepare the printing stage for use. *****This happens with a process called extrusion - the raw material is melted and pushed through a nozzle on the printer. Extrusion happens through an applied force that compresses the material before itâ€™s used.***** 
3. Designer sends CAD to printer. 
4. Printing begins.

Advantages of 3D printing:

- **Mass customization**: Helpful because in traditional manufacturing, customization requires time and cost but you can mass customize in the same batch because of the geometry used in printers. ********************(Research this more)********************
- **No need of tool or dies**: Die is a tool used to cut and form material into a desired shape. In 3D printing, designers can run test products without any tools or dies. In other words, functional prototypes can be created quicker with less cost.

Example to see the benefits of 3D printing over traditional manufacturing:

> The traditional fuel nozzle is a metal subassembly consisting of eighteen different components. To create these parts, the die-casting process requires a unique die for each component, a jet melter, and injection pumps. After manufacturing, an operator needs to assemble the fuel nozzle subassembly. To set up the production line at minimum expense, a manufacturer would need a pump costing $4995.00, a jet melter costing $8000, and a unique die for each component. The manufacturer has to create 18 dies to manufacture the various components. A single die-cast procedure costs $20,200 using the same jet melter and pump. Each component requires raw stainless steel, which costs $1.81 per pound and weights 1 lb, total.

whereas:

> 3D printing reduces weight by 25%, eliminates subassembly operation. Printer costs $4,000, material costs $184.38.

*Extra questions (some answered, some not):*

**Q:** Why haven't more companies shifted to 3D printing, knowing its benefits for faster iteration at lower cost?

**A:** 
* Limitations in materials: Types of materials the printer can print are limited. Glass, ceramics, composits are challenging for printers to print. 
* Cost: 3D printing equipment could be high. _I'd like to research what the cost to install is versus continuing current manufacturing & how long it would take for a company to break-even on their 3D printing investment. 3D printing, I think, has supply side econ of scale benefits for future and makes companies more flexible in what they can produce as it's based on software files and raw materials instead of what the current machines can already do. So, maybe there are new businesses companies can find with 3D printing that they're ignorant to b/c of status quo._
* Printing at scale: Based on what a company wants to print, the process can be longer than traditional manufacturing. _This is somewhat ambigious now._
* Design expertise: Some companies might not have expertise/people to pursue a 3D design approach.
